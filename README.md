# Dynamic Survey Form Generator

## Overview
This project enables users to dynamically create survey forms, allowing distinct surveys for different customers that can be assigned to specific users. Users have the flexibility to design diverse survey structures, incorporating various question types, question constraints, and conditional logic. For instance, users can create boolean-type questions and define corresponding question type constraints.

### Features

    Dynamic Survey Creation: Users can create unique survey forms tailored to their specific requirements.

    Question Management: The system supports the creation of different types of questions, including boolean questions, and allows users to set question constraints and type constraints.

    Question Order and Conditional Logic: Users can establish the order of survey questions and implement conditional logic. For example, if the response to a certain question is "No," subsequent questions may be skipped.

    User Assignment: Surveys can be assigned to specific users, facilitating personalized data collection.

    Survey Submission and Storage: Users can fill out the surveys and save their responses, ensuring data integrity.

    Result Analysis: Customers can review survey results and related analytics to gain insights.

### Use Case Scenario

    Survey Setup: A customer dynamically creates a survey with customized questions, constraints, and conditional logic.

    User Assignment: The customer assigns the survey to specific users for data collection.

    User Interaction: Users fill out the survey, providing responses based on the defined questions and logic.

    Result Analysis: The customer reviews survey results, leveraging the system's analytical capabilities.
